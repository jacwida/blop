The police force is responsible for the nation's day-to-day national security and law enforcement. Some police agencies across the world have done this better than others, and in today's piece, we will be torching and recognizing the greatest police forces worldwide.

## 10. Italy

Italy ranks tenth among nations with the finest police forces in the world. The organization of Italy's law enforcement is quite complicated, but I will do my best to explain it to you.

Policing in the Italian system refers to the duties of "full-powered officers" coming from the four national main forces of **Polizia di Stato (State Police)**, **Carabinieri**, **Polizia Penitenziaria** and **Guardia di Finanza (Financial Guard)**.

While the duties of these four corps' include investigating arresting, other local forces carry out limited duties.

However, the two main police forces in the country are the Carabinieri also known as the national gendarmerie, as well as the Polizia di Stato, the civil national police. The third one is the Guardia di Finanza, a militarized police force responsible for dealing with financial crime, smuggling, illegal drug trade, and others. The main forces are managed and organized on a provincial level under the authority of the Questore (the local head of police)

The italian police force mounts to a wholesome of 500,000 personnels from all the four units. They use 113 as the police emergency dial.

All Italian police forces were equipped with Italian-made police cars, with Alfa Romeos most commonly. A patrol car belonging to Polizia is nicknamed Pantera (Panther), one used by the Carabinieri is nicknamed Gazzella (Gazelle).

Every force has helicopters, trucks and campers (used as mobile offices, usually in undercover missions). They also have lamborgins but only used for emergencies
