Owning a nice house is very important because it is one of the most considered ways of determining how much wealth someone may possess in the country because we do not have a clear system like the whites that calculates how much wealth someone may be.

Uganda music artists are one of the most if not the most people who love to show case what they own no matter hoe irrelevant it may be.

We have seen lots of music artists brag on how much they spend daily, what type of cars they drive, how much their videos cost to bring to life, how often they travel to outside countries like Dubai and very little on which houses or mansions they own.

This may be attributed to the fact that building a house is expensive as some of the legendary artists who have had access to large tons of money are still struggling with building their own houses. Below we bring you the list of the top 10 Ugandan music artists with the best houses in 2024 from the last to the first with snapshots of their houses included in the article.

## The top 10 Uganda artists in Uganda with the best houses include:

At Number 10 of our top Ugandan artists with the best houses comes the 33 year old and the younger brother of the political turned musician bobi wine. Mikie wine first unveiled his mansion to the public during the pandemic in 2020 immediately after its completion in the month of October.

During his revelation, mikie wine uttered out a big secret that by the time he bought the plot of land on which his mega mansion rests, the first piece was just shs 25 million ugx and he kept on buying more land with time. Mikie wine’s mansion is located along gayaza road.

## 9. Jose Chameleone

Jose Chameleone owns a couple of houses both in the country and outside in the USA. Locally he has a house in sebuku and a yet to be finished home in lubowa. In this listing we have decided to consider his old sebuku house which he has for long wanted to sell because the house is haunted ever since a thief named robert kiramagi in 2012 got burned in the house and later died on his way to the hospital.

The sebuku house was a hit years ago but with time, many artists have managed to construct new houses with new designs and therefore this explains why the wale wale hit maker has been thrown all the way to the 9th position on our ranking list.

May be when he finishes his newly constructed house, that will hopefully change his position in our list but for now, number 9 is what he deserves.

## 8. Mesearch Ssemakula
