The latest News reaching our desk indicate that the <strong><em>ekyangoba ebusabaala</em></strong> hit maker Maurice kirya is in plans to hold a nude party for his forth coming 38th birthday celebrations where he won't accept clothes nor phones for those who wish to leak what will happen there. Maurice kirya has of lately been  in the uganda news over last few weeks since his encounter with lydia jasmine when he told the media houses that he has never heard of any female ugandan artist named lydia jasmine nor has he ever heard a song from her. However just after that a photo suggesting both Maurice kirya and Lydia jasmine may have been chewing each other started to circulate over the internet. According to maurice kirya, phones and clothes will not be allowed on his 38th coming birthday party that will take place early next month on the 4th. <blockquote>“My birthday is coming up on the 4th November, I am yet to decide where to put the party, no phones or anything will be allowed into the party, no clothes either, birthday suit things. Everything will be available onsite,” Kirya tweeted.</blockquote> Well for now no body knows whether he was just joking or uttering out dead truth. Anyway 4th November is not far and we shall see to it.
