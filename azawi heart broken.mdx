Many ugandan artists never come out to reveal who they are dating but once in a while we come to know of their failed attempts to find someone they would love for the rest of their lives.

Just a few days ago, bruno k came out and revealed to the public about his love for posha and the two are soon expecting a new child. He posted photos of the pregnant posha with captions of love of life.

In uganda only the legendary artists of bobi, bebe, chameleone and some others used to date publically but currently almost no young artist would like to reveal their relationships any more.

This is mostly due to the instability of these relationships as most barely hang for a few months.
