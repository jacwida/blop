A few years ago, attempting to rank the best music artists in northern Uganda looked a bit awkward and stupid, however as years have gone by, music artists in the region have rapidly grown from mere curtain raisers to hitting their own mega concerts.

In this article, I ranked and reviewed the top 10 best music artists in northern Uganda, who have shown consistency in making hit songs and entertaining the northern Uganda general population.

### Below are the top 10 best music artists in northern Uganda in 2023

## 1. Pato loverboy

Pato loverboy is the most consistent music artist northern Uganda has come to see. He has been on the regional music charts for as long as I can remember.

He scooped NUMA's best artist for the year 2023 that took place at pece stadium. He was the first northern ugandan modern artist to hold a stand alone mega concert without an artist from kampala and it was filled to the maximum at acholi inn.

Aparently he is the most expensive northern uganda artist at the moment a head of eddy wizzy.

## 2. Eddy Wizzy

Eddy Wizzy is people’s favourite artist because he has stuck to singing all his songs in the local language. Unlike eezzy who mixes his songs with Luganda and English, eddy wizzy on the other hand sings purely Acholi and this explains why he is loved so much by the common flock.

Its impossible to enter a club/bar in northern uganda and you leave without jamming to some tunes of eddy wizzy. Each year he continues to hit up the people in northern uganda. In 2024, he is to hold his first mega concert on the 11th of march at acholi inn.
He is the second most expensive artist in Northern uganda after pato.

## 3. Eezzy

Eezzy is the 3rd best music artist in Gulu and Northern Uganda in 2024.Eezzy managed to make it to the national charts with his single named tumbiza sound which turned into a nationwide anthem and even prompted the minister for health Dr Ruth Acheng to ban the song from playing on radio stations and television in the country.

In August of year 2022, eezzy filled up Acholi inn in his I survive love and peace concert which is the most successful concert an Acholi artist has ever held.

He also became the first artist to fill frontpage lira in his extended I survive love and peace concert in the Lango land.

## 4. Polite Mosko

The Pa Angeyo hitmaker was undoubtedly expected on our list of the top 10 best music artists in northern Uganda. He had the best of 2022.

His song pa angeyo has been played on several national television stations and this has boosted him to hold the next mega concert at pece stadium after eezzy.

## 5. Judas Rapknowledge

Judas has for long ruled over the rap category of northern Uganda and has scooped award after award including his latest two of best hip hop artists and best collabo in the 17th NUMA awards.

He recently fought with the faded rapper Mussolini a beef judas rendered useless and refused to iterate

## 6. Chameroon

Twidukire Ronnie best known as chameroon is the 6th best music artist in Uganda in 2024. The Gunya hitmaker is currently the best dance hall artist in the northern region following his winnings in the 17th NUMA awards that transpired earlier this year.

Chameroon is under the zodongo entertainment management a heavily wealthy young management ready to promote any promising talent in the region.

## 7. Okeng Born Town

Okeng born town is one of the two artists who have so far performed at every concert that has taken place in Gulu this year.

First is himself and the other is eezzy. He has had a good year as his 2021 album has bought him a favour ticket among concert promoters who have decided not to leave him at home for every concert.

He is the least known on our list but he has worked to earn his spot.

## 8. Quincy

The pine avenue belle and the best female NUMA award winner, Quincy comes at the 8th position for the best music artists in northern Uganda.

Quincy just like pato loverboy is one of the music artists who have been consistent year after year partially due to her good management but largely because of her talent.

## 9. Bosmic Otim

Though he fled the country, otim bosmic is still among the top listened, loved and requested artists in the entire northern region.

Otim bosmic managed to scoop the Most Influential Personality Of The Year in the recently concluded NUMA awards earlier this year.

Bosmic has spent the biggest percentage of this year in juba due to fear for his life as the ruling government was threatening him according to bosmic.
