A new war in the northern uganda music industry has just sparked off between faded rapper mussolini and the Soulz Of Afrika boss judas rapknowledge. Mussolini who has recently been off charts has resurrected with a tarnishing tune dubbed "Wee Yoo'' where he called judas a mediocre and a pretender in the rap industry.

Judas has for long reigned over the rap genre category in the northern Uganda region and has sqooped a couple of awards including his latest northern Uganda music award (NUMA) of best hip hop and rap artist of the year early in january this year. Many music artists have used the tarnishing technique to capture people's interests and get their music out to the world.

This has been seen quite common in the Uganda music industry with the likes of ffeffe bussi who in his song "who is who" dissed almost every rapper in the country. Gravity omutujju also in his song named musomesa, the artist went hard on legendary luga flow artist gnl zamba when he called him faded and crowned himself the new norm. Bobi wine, bebe cool, chameleone, goodlyfe all have used the dissing technique to spark interest among their fans and get their music on the charts and it has worked well for them.

Judas hasn't yet replied to mussolini's call but he is most likely to do so because mussolini's mere existence threatens his thriving rap kingdomÂ  in the northern Uganda region. One advantage of beef between music artists, the fans get the privilege to listen to new creativity and music. Each artists is always on the verge to show that he rules and the fans tend to benefit in the long run. We still wonder whether the beef between mussolini and judas will also juice some new creativity or it will cause havoc and hatred in the region
