Patrick Mukwana aka Alien, CEO of Fangone Forest, is planning to stage his highly awaited "Nkwacho" music festival on the same day as his adversary Abitex's "Enkuuka 2023" end-of-year bash.

Since the pencil-sized events organizer lost out with Kimenke when discussions stalled over his impending "Nkwacho" festival, the fighting and antagonism between the once great pals has been far from done.

To top things off, Abitex declared during the start of CBS FM radio's annual "Enkuuka" fete that he had prohibited performers Alien Skin and Ronald Mayinja from headlining the event owing to suspected indiscipline.

According to Abitex Promotions, he was hopeful that Alien Skin and Ronald Mayinja would attempt to carry out disrespectful acts during their concerts, such as pulling down their pants.
Such activities would not only degrade the event's prestige, but would also demonstrate disrespect for the Kabaka of Buganda, who will be in attendance.

As the adage goes, 'Tit for Tat is fair game,' and Alien Skin stated his plan to challenge his enemy Abitex by staging the "Nkwacho" event on the same day as 'Enkuuka' in a defiant letter over the weekend.

Both events will take place on December 31, 2023 at Nakivubo Ham Stadium and Lubiri Mengo, respectively, and Alien Skin has also announced a drop in the admission cost to Shs 10000, which is cheaper than Abitex's Shs15000 for the 'Enkuuka'.
