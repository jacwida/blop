We have seen a number of artists come into the limelight of Ugandan music with hits that broke everyone’s expectations….hits that made the old, the young, and the unborn split their bones.

However a small fraction of these artists have managed to counteract these hits as they have failed to get other new hit songs and in this lengthy article, we shall be going through a number of these artists who have failed to get another hit following their first national hit……

## List of Ugandan Artists who have failed to counteract their hit songs.

## 1. Quex

The kachumbali hit is one of those songs that gave Ugandans a vibe during the pandemic period. The song was released in 2019 and gained popularity in the following year when people were cooped up during the pandemic period.

Quex released a couple of other hits like rastaman, vibe ekute but all are just like they have never been hard of…

## 2. Eezzy

Eezzy also got his national hit during the covid 19 period. His hit “tumbiza sound’ was a national banger to the extent that it threatened the covid 19 SOPs and it forced the Ugandan minister of health jane acheng to ban it from streaming on all local tv stations and radios.

The northern Uganda king has released a couple of singles and collabos after the mega tumbiza sound but all have just been in vain…He however remains a big name in northern Uganda and the luo music industry

## 3. Alimpa Ronald

Alimpa released the seen don song also known as lusuku lwa cement at the end of the covid period. The song immediately picked the momentum with out even producing the video for it….(which came in later)

Many Ugandans even went ahead and started comparing him to the late mozey radio. The song picked up momentum super fast and ruled over song countdowns and tiktok timelines.

As of the writing, alimpa is still ill and all the sounds he released after seen don have all been failures.

## 4. Ricky Miles

Last year (2022) Uganda saw a rise in the number of new artists and among these ones was ricky miles…..Ricky miles shot into the limelight with his single dubbed “insane”.

Unlike his fellow artist whom he came with at the same time vyroota who has continued to release new songs, ricky miles has completely failed to get a new banger since his insane hit.

## 5. Samali Matovu

Samali matovu 11 years ago shook the ugandan playlists with the reknown Omukwano gunyuma nga gutandika hit…

It was a big song as it took over the number one slot on a number of countdowns across the country. However, she failed to respond with a better hit and ever since then her abouts in the music world are unknown.
