Uganda singer kid dee has vowed to fight the basiyazi community in uganda after he barely survived being conned by one last night.

According to kid dee, last night as he was busy smoking joint, he was approaching with a musiyazi who was ready to shoot his shots.

According to kid dee, the musiyazi thought that since he was wearing earings he was a musiyazi too. This is because most basiyazi people identify themselves through earings.

So after this encounter where kid dee was saved by his friends, the singer has vowed to use all the power he has to open a fight against them

He also went onto his instagram and openly opened the war against the basiyazi in uganda
