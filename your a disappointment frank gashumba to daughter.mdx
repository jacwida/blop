On January 11, city businessman Frank Gashumba expressed concern and utter disappointment in her daughter, TV presenter Sheila Gashumba, in a rather deeply sad audio leaked on radio presenter Dikteta Mark’s Facebook page.

The 10-minute audio features a deep conversation between Gashumba and a woman named Diana about the numerous obstacles and huddles he has had to deal with in order to see his daughter become the most successful woman of her generation, only to be met with disappointment.

“I’ve always thought Sheila can be a very successful woman with her brand and image, owning a line of cosmetics under her name, but how would she accomplish all that if she unintentionally spends all her money?” Gashumba worriedly questioned Diana in the audio.

Gashumba continues by expressing his displeasure with the guys his daughter chose, particularly the well-known God’s Plan, whom he characterized as a ragged, reckless man. He also informed Diana how devastated he had been when Sheila got a tattoo of the same man on her body.

“Diana, I’m in pain. I’m hurt, he stated in reference to his daughter.

Gashumba said that Sheila has repeatedly lied to him when he has requested her to show him contracts and the amount of money she earns from her work in bars and TV for a long time in order for them to plan how to invest that money.

After listening to the audio, one would then ask themselves why Gashumba keeps defending his daughter all the time. He, however, said in the audio that he believes that, as a parent, you have to defend your child in public at all costs and lash out at them in privacy.

However, Gashumba’s point of dismay from daughter stems from not getting the best out of her yet, despite taking the to the best schools there was, and exposing her to opportunities at an early age

“If I had not taken Sheila to very good schools like Galaxy International School where I was paying USD4000, Taibah and Kabojja International Schools, I would be guilty as charged for not preparing her very well. But I did my best for that child,” he said

As of now, social media is already doing what it does best – giving mixed reactions.
In her response about the audio Sheila Gashumba took to Twitter and said: “One fact is I do not talk about my family or my relationships no matter the situation. I do not need to explain myself to people because I know who I am. This is the first and last comment I’m giving about this audio going around. Goodnight perfect parents and children.”
