During today's parliamentary session, the woman mp of mbarara district has questioned the neccessary authorities on where money from taxes ugandans pay daily is put to use.

Alot of ugandans are pissed on how much tax they are forced to pay and yet nothing they see is being put to use in the correct manner.

Alot of the tax is just swindled by government officials or put on useless projects. Alot of ugandans came out and supported her statement.

For some ugandans, they think the ugandan parliament is big problem this country is facing forinstance, when it comes to issues like hiking salaries for mps the entire parliament votes collectively yet issues facing the common person, they tend to ignore.

In a recent interview, we asked youths who import some 3D printing materials who shared a number of the disappointments they have encountered like inconsistent takes even when your importing the same material every time. Poor communication and some even loosing their material even after clearing custom duty not being left.

The country is currently in chuckles and now the people demand URA to come out and explain to them where the huge taxes they continously pay daily are being spent.
