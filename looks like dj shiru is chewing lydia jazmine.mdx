Lydia jazmine and uganda's legendary deejay shiru may be chewing each other's gooddies. The two new love birds(Lydia jasmine and dj shiru) are well known to share the same birthday date and back in 2017 they even went a head and  held a joint birthday celebration at club amnesia which left a lot of people questioning the relationship between the two.

Yesterday( 23 october 2022) lydia jasmine went onto her social media and posted several images of herself and a couple of friends having a good time which same images dj shiru got and reposted on his social media platforms. Many fans of the two popular artists started wondering what is going on between the two as many celebrity relationships in uganda have started off exactly in the same manner. For instance look at the one drink for the night singer bruno k and ntv's news anchor faridah nakazibwe rumoured relationship.

Bruno k started by posting a couple of faridah's pictures on social media, which he later then upgraded and produced a song in attributed to faridah and now the two are rumoured to chew each other. The female side is always the most emotional but of this writing, lydia jasmine hasn't yet responded but some say she liked the dj shiru's post and later unliked it.

Dj shiru tried to cover the post with a couple of youtube comedy videos on top of it on his timeline but since its facebook, the most popular posts always get promoted and that's how we managed to get to it. Lets wait and see how this new and hidden relationship will unfold in the future. Many celebrity relationships in uganda have not lasted long and we still wonder whether this one between the two will survive the test of time.

We have seen a couple of these temporary relationships with Daddy andre at the fore front of them. Daddy andre with angella katatumba, daddy andre with nina roz, nina roz with bennie gunter, alex muhangi and galaxy fm's prima, and our latest between maggie( ak 47's widow) and rabadaba to mention but a few all these celebrity relationships didn't survive the test of time though some even included okukyala.

Some uganda music artists have used these short relationships to promote their new songs among their fan bases and the other question we need to ask ourselves  may be whether the two are working on a new banger and now want to spark some intimate interest among their fans.
