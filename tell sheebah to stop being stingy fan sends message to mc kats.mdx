**“We post, we request her song, we vote but she gives us nothing in return, not even a ticket,”** – the fan wrote to mc kats.

Sheebah hasn’t yet opened up on the claim but mc kats as predicted, took the conversation initiated by the fan, screenshotted it and posted on twitter while tagging sheebah karungi in the process.
