They said that playing deceased songs over living musicians adds no influence or value to the industry, and they urged media personalities to let the departed rest in peace.

> Radios and TVs should stop playing the music of the dead people, those people are gone, and they can’t take the music industry anywhere, acknowledge the living, and let the dead rest in peace.

> **Ugaboys**

Their ideas have been met with conflicting reactions from fellow musicians such as Kalifah AgaNaga, who has since encouraged them to focus on releasing and producing better music, claiming that the direction they are heading will breed hatred and hostility for their brand.

> I think it’s better you just do music, but you creating hate around your brand. This is too much.

> **AgaNaga**

The duo, however, went ahead to shed more light on their statements as they responded to Kalifah AgaNaga noting the living have not been given the much airplay as they deserve.

> My bro even the living right now are doing good music, You are also doing good music for God’s sake. But wait someday, God forbid, the flowers u will receive, I bet you have never gotten a quarter of them. We have a lot to talk about this whole issue only if the industry is willing to listen to us who are still in the struggle.
