I am going to come down there and punch him in the face,” Kabiito charged during a phone interview with Bukedde TV. “I do know who that man is, I have never met him. Let them argue out their problems but keep me out of it,” he added

Kabiito was reacting to claims by Nateete that the two had met each other and worked together to support baby Destiny in the early 2010s.

Nateete claims to have been with Nwagi in the late 2000s when they were both in school. In an interview, he said he broke up with Nwagi in 2013 after a disagreement and that she took their 2-year-old baby to her dad, Mr Kabiito.

“That is how I got to meet Mzee Kabiito because I had to keep checking on the baby,” he said. “He was very friendly to me until around 2016 when he cut off the interaction.”

But Mzee Kabiito denied knowledge of Nateete, referring to him as a goon. He also revealed in the interview that he knows and has met the real father of his grandchild.

Nateete, a budding musician himself recently stormed the home of Nwagi demanding to see Destiny. A viral video caught by passersby showed him exchanging with another man at the gate. It is understood that both Nwagi and her daughter were inside the residence at the time.

Nateete also released a song in which he claims to be Nwagi’s baby daddy and demands to be reunited with his child.

In a Facebook post, Nateete said his interest is not taking away the child by getting access to her.

Winnie Nwagi however, rubbished Nateete’s claims, likening him to a person on drugs.
