Although Bruno K is well known for being a player when it comes to women, something feels different this time. It appears that he has finally mustered the courage to make public the woman he genuinely loves.

Bruno K shared a picture of himself and Posha on social media yesterday with the statement, "Everything seems right when the right woman walks into your life. I went to Kamukuzi in Mbarara and got myself a good woman"and his supporters were driven completely insane.

A few hours before, he had tweeted pictures of posha with a belly showing she is almost ready to deliver him twins.

Bruno K has been in a couple of love fights with females like Dorah and Vanessa, whom he basically played over, and possessed by his passion for Faridah Nakazibwe.

For the fans just as expected they were very exciting. One commented on bruno k's post saying that 'There's always a right woman walking into your life every six months". Another also wrote: "Museveni's letter to Bruno K's new woman You're not the first or the last and he will dump you too and deny the pregnancy. Prepare money for DNA". The reactions are so many...some encouraging while others telling posha to prepare a plan B.

Bruno k whether serious or just playing posha will be revealed with time but for the moment, he seems seriously taken over by the relationship.

For plans for the wedding, he did not share anything or reveal he they had one.
