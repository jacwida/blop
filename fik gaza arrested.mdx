News about when fik gaza will be released are still unclear following the artist's arrest upon landing in saudi arabia on tuesday.

Bigeye ug was the first to report about his detainment who reported that his arrest was due to commotion he had caused on the airport upon his arrival in saudi arabia.

According to Bigeye,Gaza’s arrival at the airport drew considerable attention as supporters gathered around him, leading to a commotion which apparently caught the attention of Saudi officers, who intervened and subsequently took Gaza into custody.

As of today (april 25th) there is no news about any leads towards his release however many ugandan artists have come out and condemned the arrest of fik gaza with the notable ones being bobi wine and ykee Benda.

Bobi wine through his twitter account has come out and pledged his assistance in helping to work upon the release of fik gaza. Bobi wine has pledged that his NUP team both in saudi and here in uganda are willing to do everything to see that gaza is returned back to the home soil safely.

Just a few days ago, Ykee bendahad also issued a warning to all ugandan artists who intend to have plans to perform in saudi arabia to withhold them because its not a safe space.

In a report by nilepost, ykee benda blames fik gaza's arrest on ‘jealous’ Ugandan promoters based in Saudi, whom he says have resorted to scuffles instead of uniting and working together.

According to ykee benda, what is happenning to fik gaza has actually ever happenned to him and so he decided to declare saudi arabia a danger zone.
