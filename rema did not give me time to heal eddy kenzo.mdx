Eddy Kenzo and Rema were married for more than five years but their marriage ended in tears in 2019. Rema Namakula didn’t give Eddy Kenzo time to heal she immediately moved on with Hamza Ssebunya and the couple married officially in December 2019.

By the time all this was taking place, Eddy Kenzo was out of Uganda for a business trip and the only thing he would do about his emotions was to cry on social media.

In a recent interview, Eddy Kenzo said the only reason why he cried is that someone gets had spent some good time with was getting with someone she had known for a few months to put him down. Kenzo said the hardest part was knowing they have a child together who will forever bring them together and that’s the only reason why he cried.

Talented Kenzo said nothing else can make him cry especially from the media because he had heard and seen everything in his life. “You ask yourself, why she is dealing with people she is known for two months to send me back to the village, and yet we have a child that will bind us together for life? That thing hurt me and drew tears out of me.

But no one should deceive you that someone will say things that will draw tears out of me. You can’t say anything that will scare me,” Kenzo revealed.
