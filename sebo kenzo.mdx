# Sebo kenzo Now days anyone can buy the views – Chameleone

Kenzo lamented a number of words that made him bite his tongue after returning from the Grammys last week. Eddy kenzo claimed that Lutaaya, a late-born African banger maker, has no better song than his.

Many ugandans have come out and given in their own options on the issue and the newly joined is the uganda legendary artist joseph mayanja.

According to eddy kenzo’s claim, he has songs on a number of streaming platforms that have surpassed 100s of millions of views yet philly bongole lutaya’s songs just have a few millions on those very streaming platforms.

while speaking to kasuku Chameleone said: **\*“I don’t want to blow my own trumpet… we’ve flown private jets… when there was no Instagram. I’m older than Instagram, I’m older than Facebook. We grew up in a non-digitized generation… that wasn’t a digital generation.”**

**He went on: “I also sang a Christmas song. Mine. But every Christmas, they play [Philly Lutaya’s songs]. You don’t compare numbers on a generation that wasn’t digital… Today you can buy followers on YouTube [or any other platform]… You can buy followers, you can buy likes… those are the musicians that release a video, and in one day it has 10 million views.”**

He added: “I can also buy them because I know how they do it, but I don’t want to … because I’m organic… But Philly Lutaaya!… that’s a man who sang on Vinyl… His music was played on cassette… He only released one song on the CD called Alone and Frightened… so, you can’t compare French cut [before he could complete it Kasuku said Marine, and Chameleone laughed]… people always give me their opinions, so I don’t want you to limit what I say. It’s my own opinion for that particular… so, comparing numbers doesn’t count.”

As of the writing, Kenzo hasn’t retracted.
